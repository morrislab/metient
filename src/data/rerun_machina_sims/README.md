* `m5` and `m8` directories are taken by running MACHINA's `simulate` executable (see `generate.sh` in each individual directory, e.g. m5/M/generate.sh)
* `*_clustered_input`
  * `cluster_*_seed*.txt` files were generated by running SPRUCE (via MACHINA's `cluster` executable) on the `reads_seed*.tsv` files in the `m5` and `m8` directories. Each line corresponds to a cluster of mutations, and the line number indicates the cluster number.
  * `cluster_*_seed*.tsv` contains reference and variant read counts for the clustered data. These were generated by running [create_conf_intervals_from_machina_sims.sh](src/util/create_conf_intervals_from_machina_sims.sh)
* `*_mut_trees` were generated by running MACHINA's `generatemutationtrees` executable on the cluster tsv's mentioned above. See [generate_mutation_trees.sh](src/util/generate_mutation_trees.sh)
